NAME
----
zstdra - a random access decompressor for the zstd format. 

SYNOPSIS
--------
zstdra filename.zst ?start? ?size? ...

DESCRIPTION
-----------
zstdra provides (pseudo) random access to files compressed using zstd-mt.
zstdra can decompress an zst file starting from a given (uncompressed)
position, and continue up to a given (uncompressed) size. The uncompressed
data is sent to stdout. zstdra with only the filename as parameter will
decompress the entire file to stdout. Multiple start size ranges can be
given: the ranges will be concatenated in the output

Files should be compressed using zstd-mt (https://github.com/mcmilk/zstdmt/blob/master/lib/zstd-mt.h) 
rather than plain zstd because it compresses the file in equally sized
(uncompressed) independent chunks that can be skipped or decompressed as
needed, making the access to part of the data more efficient. You can
specify the chunk size using the -b option; smaller values make for finer
grained (and faster) random access but decrease compression efficienty a bit, e.g.
a test file compressed with a chunck size of 1 was 0.015% smaller than one
compressed with chunk size of 0.5.
zstdra will work on default zstd compressed files, but not efficiently.

For faster access, an index file (with the name filename.zst.zsti) can be
made using:
zstdindex filename.zst
The zsti file contains a list of the starting positions of the blocks in a
binary format (prepended with a yaml header describing the binary data.
With this index the position of the start block can be obtained directly
without parsing and skipping blocks in the zst file.
Making an index will fail on default zstd compressed files.

BUILDING
--------
zstdra and zstdindex can be build by running make in the src directory.
The make script expects a built zstd library in zstd-ori/zstd-1.3.8.
The build directory contains scripts to build a widely compatible zstdra
binary (build/hbb_make_zstdra.sh) and the required zstd library
(build/hbb_make_zstd.sh) using the Holy Build Box environment
(https://github.com/phusion/holy-build-box). The Holy Build Box requires
docker to be installed and usable.
After building, the zstdra and zstdindex binaries are in the directory bin.
