lz4i index format
=================

An lz4i file contains an array with the starting positions of each block
in an lz4 compressed file. With this array the position of the start block
can be obtained directly without parsing and skipping blocks in the lz4
file.

The lz4i file is in combines a textual description of the data
(in yaml) with the data itself in binary form, further called bym (binary
yaml) format. bym files are thus selfdescriptive in the text part, which
for lz4i files contains the following lines:

#bym lz4i
---
name: lz4index
version: 0.1
type: array
datatype: uint64
byteorder: l
usize: uncompressedsize
binsize: binarysize
#binary data follows
...

The first line is a yaml comment (starts with #) indicating the file type.
The first 4 (magic) characters (#bym) indicate a bym format, the rest lz4i.
This is followed by a yaml document (opening with --- and closing with ...)
describing the data. bym format expects the fields name, version, type, datatype, 
byteorder (l for little-endian and b for big-endian) and binsize (the size
of the binary data) for the description of the data. lz4i has an extra
field (usize) to indicate the original (uncompressed) size of the file.
The document has some padding spaces (after the comment "# binaray data follows")
so that the binary data is 8-byte aligned.

The binary data following the yaml block is as described and array of 64
bit little-endian integers.

While bym supports multiple documents in a file by simple concatenation of
the individual files (alternating yaml and binary), lzra expects the
lz4index document to be the first in the file, and gives an error (lz4i
error: only lz4index supported) if it is not.
